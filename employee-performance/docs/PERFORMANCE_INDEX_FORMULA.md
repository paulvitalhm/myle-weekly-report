# Performance Index Formula - Official Documentation

## 🎯 The Golden Rule: Never Guess, Always Calculate

**Core Principle**: The performance index must be calculated with 100% mathematical certainty using only the data we have. No assumptions, no estimates, no "smart guesses."

## 🍋 Lemonade Stand Example (Grade 5 Level)

**Sarah's Lemonade Stand:**
- Works 4 hours
- Makes $20 total
- Performance Index = $20 ÷ 4 hours = **5.0**

**Tom's Lemonade Stand:**
- Works 5 hours  
- Makes $15 total
- Performance Index = $15 ÷ 5 hours = **3.0**

**Who's better?** Sarah! (5.0 > 3.0)

## 🏢 Real World Application

### The Formula:
```
Performance Index = Total Revenue Allocated ÷ Total Hours Worked
```

### Revenue Allocation Rules:
1. **Proportional to Hours**: Revenue is divided based on hours worked on each job
2. **Net Revenue**: Transportation costs are deducted from individual share
3. **Total Money**: Use only the money we can track and verify

## 🌟 Paul & Mariana Example - The RIGHT Way

### The Data We Have:
- **House 1 (Cameron)**: $150
- **House 2 (Laval)**: $87.50  
- **Total Money**: $237.50
- **Mariana's Hours**: 5h 10min = 5.17 hours
- **Paul's Hours**: 1 hour
- **Who Worked Where**: Paul only at House 1, Mariana at both

### The Data We DON'T Have:
- Hours spent on House 1 vs House 2
- Exact time split between houses
- Individual hours per house

### The CORRECT Calculation:

**Mariana (Easy Case):**
- Revenue: $237.50 (all houses she worked on)
- Hours: 5.17 hours (all her hours that day)
- Index: $237.50 ÷ 5.17 = **45.9**

**Paul (The Only Logical Way):**
Since we don't know hours per house, we use the ONLY data we have:
- Revenue: (1h ÷ 5.17h total) × $237.50 = **$45.93**
- Hours: 1 hour
- Index: $45.93 ÷ 1 = **45.9**

**Result**: Both get the same index (45.9) because we only have total hours, not house-specific hours.

## 🏆 Performance Tiers

- **🟢 Top Performers**: Index ≥ 47
- **🟡 Good Performers**: Index 35-46  
- **🔴 Needs Improvement**: Index < 35

## ⚠️ Critical Rule: No Assumptions Ever

**NEVER DO:**
- "Let's say House 1 took 3 hours..."
- "Maybe Paul spent half his time there..."
- "We can estimate that..."

**ALWAYS DO:**
- Use ONLY the data in the database
- Apply the formula exactly as written
- If data is missing, calculate what you CAN calculate
- Document when assumptions would be needed

## 📝 Documentation Requirements

When data is incomplete, the system must:
1. Calculate using available data only
2. Clearly note what assumptions would be needed for perfect accuracy
3. Never invent or estimate missing values
4. Apply the formula blindly and consistently

## 🔍 Validation Checklist

For any performance index calculation:
- [ ] Only used verified database values
- [ ] No estimated or assumed numbers
- [ ] Formula applied exactly as specified
- [ ] Missing data clearly documented
- [ ] Results are mathematically certain

**Remember**: This is math, not magic. We calculate what we can calculate, and we never guess. 📊✅
